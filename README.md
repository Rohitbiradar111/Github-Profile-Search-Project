GitHub Profile Search is a responsive web app that retrieves GitHub user profiles including details like avatars, bios, and the latest repositories directly from the GitHub API for quick, user-friendly insights.
<br>
<br>
Used the GitHub API to fetch essential user data, such as the user's avatar, biography, followers count, following count and an overview of their repositories. Displayed this information in a clean, card-based format, ensuring users can easily view important details about any GitHub profile they search for.
<br>
<br>
Showcased five most recent repositories from each user, with each repository name being a clickable link. These links open the respective GitHub repository pages, allowing users to quickly access more detailed information about the repositories and interact with them directly.
<br>
<br>
Implemented strong error handling to ensure that users are notified if their search returns no results or if thereâ€™s an issue with the input. The application also fetches real-time data from GitHub, so users always get the most up-to-date profile and repository information.
<br>
<br>
Designed the layout using CSS, which makes the interface responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes. The app is powered by JavaScript to handle API requests efficiently, and used mobile first media queries to ensure the experience is optimized for smaller devices while still providing full functionality on larger screens.
